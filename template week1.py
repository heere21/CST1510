# ==================================================================== INPUT
# 1. Ask the user for your three values.
label = input("Enter a label: ")
first = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
second = float(input("Enter the second number: "))




# ================================================================== PROCESS
# 2. Work out what you were NOT given.       [Typical and above]
difference = abs(first - second)
percent = (first / second) * 100 


# =================================================================== OUTPUT
# 3. Print the report.
#
#    Threshold : print the three values you were given, inside a border
#    Typical   : add difference and percent, 2 decimal places, right-aligned
#    Excellent : difference always shows its sign, plus one line of your own
#
#    Useful:   f"{value:>10.2f}"    right-aligned, 2 decimal places
#              f"{value:>+10.2f}"   the same, but always shows the sign

print()
print("=" * 34)
print(f"  RECORD CHECK  -  {label}")
print("=" * 34)

# : your report lines go here
print(f"First number : {first:>10.2f}")
print(f"Second number: {second:>10.2f}")
print(f"Difference   : {difference:>+10.2f}")

print(f"Status : Processing complete.")
print("=" * 34)


# ==========================================================================
# 4. Before you finish:
#
#    [ ] Run it three times with different numbers
#    [ ] Run it with a total of 0 and write the error in your journal
#    [ ] Check every variable name says what it holds
#    [ ] Show it to the person next to you
